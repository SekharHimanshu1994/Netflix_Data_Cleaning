Additionally, instead of using the ggplot2 package, Tableau was used to showcase some of the Tableau skills.\n","\n","The final result of this project is a thorough analysis and presentation of insights from the cleaned data set, demonstrating the proficiency in data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization using Tableau.\n","\n","**Project Problems**\n","\n","This portfolio project aimed to answer several questions related to a data set containing movie details from 2015 to 2021.

Is the number of languages related to getting a high IMDB score or being nominated for awards?\n","3.
